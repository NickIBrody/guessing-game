##  What is this?

This is a simple number guessing game made for:
- practicing Rust 
- learning how terminal input works
- having fun without installing 200 dependencies

The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100,  
and you try to guess it before losing your sanity.

## Notes

Part of the development process included bouncing ideas off an AI assistant —
similar to rubber duck debugging, just less judgmental.
